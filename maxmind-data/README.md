Optionally provide maxmind geoip data.

See guide at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/geoip2/ for how to get it.

Once you've done that you should have two extra files in here:
- GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
- GeoLite2-City.mmdb

We have a karrot-specific account you can use for downloading the files.
